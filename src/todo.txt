DOCUMENTATION:
    Look at how Nystrom design docs for Wren
    The embedded compiler/vm in browser is neat
        look at using emscripten to compiler to webassembly

ADDING FEATURES:
    Add correctness tests for new features
    Check that ALL memory is freed if GC is called at end of main()
    Add more native functions - add way to import native functions
    TODO: need a way to test type checking

IMPLEMENTATION:
    Clean up code

    Run each test to check output

    Problem in parser, make_decl_class.  Inferred type for properties
        doesn't work here - trying to set the property signature to
        a NULL (that's changed to Value).  Using dv->sig, but it's
        NULL bc we are inferring property types.

        Won't be able to get the type until the rhs is compiled
        This is causing GET_PROP and SET_PROP to break.

        Could try to update signature after compiling the class, but
        would need to take care with inheritance - right now
        we are checking if overwritten type is the same.  Will need
        to do it in this order:
            compile class (adding all properties)
            update class signature with inferred types
                struct and function signatures should be fine
            Check super struct properties using new signature:
                if overwritten, check that type matches
                if not overwritten, add prop to struct
            return the new update signature, and let NODE_DECL_VAR
                update the class signature in locals
            

    in read_sig() in parser, returning NULL if next token is TOKEN_EQUAL
    in compiler NODE_DECL_VAR, need to deal with a NULL signature.
    if the right side is a function or struct, need to get that sig
    before compiling right side.  If it's anything else, can compile
    and then get that signature.

    Shorthand problem: can't do recursion or have structs within same
        struct since we normally add_local BEFORE the right hand side
        is compiled so that it's defined.

        could we just look on the right side? Before add_local?
            This will work.  Just set sig to NULL

        if ':' is followed by '=', then what to do about signatures?
        a := 1
        b := "dogg"
        c := (n: int, m: int) -> int {
            -> m * n
        }
        Dog := struct {
            name := "Mittens"
        }

        dog := Dog()

    Change display of test results for easier digestion:
        sum all test and include failed/passed tests count
        print names of failed tests only

    Compile to webassembly and run in browser
        test with simple 'hello world' program first
        test with program that reads in text from text box (our script)
            and returns info about that text
        integrate final code

    Update documentation to include new syntax + List/Map
        and include small box to write /run test scripts

    have Maps and Lists return nil for invalid values
        get rid of default values
        in vm, fill invalid values with nil
        change tests to match 

    find python native function list (for early python versions)
        and add those functions
        copy() for instances/lists/maps
        casting to string/int/float

    How about letting declarations leave NIL on the stack, and then 
    popping them off by wrapping them in expr_stmt?  This would
    get rid of the weird NIL checking in OP_POP.

        had bug before where setting a variable to nil and 
        return nil as the type (which didn't get popped)
        changed code so that variable signature was returned

    Implement for each loop
        for i: int in list {
            print(i)
        }

        for i: int in 1..19 {

        }

    copy() to make copies of instances, maps and lists

    Need to add parse error if quote is not closed (rather than quietly failing)
        and program crashing

    Need to make parser and compiler errors NOT fail silently and instead
        give user a useful message. Will require more careful handling of
        parse/compiler/runtime errors - including syncing so that multiple
        errors can be shown

    When compile_node() is called, should check if return value is NULL
        make all errors return NULL, rather than a signature of type NIL
        NIL type signatures are valid, whereas NULL will signal an error

    Allow struct instantiation to have arguments that set fields
        by order of declaration.  Use must include all arguments, but
        may leave them empty if the default value is desired

        Dog: struct = struct {
            name: string = "Mittens"
            age: int = 3
            length: float = 12.3
        }

        Dog("Bubbles", 23, 1.32)
        Dog(, 23, 1.32)
        Dog(,,) is the same as Dog()

    property names are being added as constants for both OP_GET_PROP
    and OP_SET_PROP, but they aren't really constants.  What other
    way could this be done more clearly.  Interning!!!
        this will also make value comparisons of strings faster
        (right now need to compare lengths + memcmp)

    Does NODE_DECl_VAR only for primitive types, or is it for functions/classes too?
        add ability to assign variables to classes, function, instances

        How about assigning functions to other functions?
            I don't think we support this right now:
            my_fun: () -> = other_fun

    Clear up the warnings (especially with switch statements)

    String Interning

    When a function returns, it closes any upvalues, but we don't
        see the call to OP_CLOSE_UPVALUE - need to add more instructions to
        disassemble chunk OR somehow make returning from a function call
        OP_CLOSE_UPVALUE for clarity.  Is there any situation where
        OP_CLOSE_UPVALUE actually gets called (rather than OP_RETURN 
        just doing all the work?)

    in compiler, CALL and CASCADE CALL share a lot of code - pull that into a function

    Native functions - start with clock() for measuring time
        should have an OP_CALL_NATIVE code

    Having to call free_sig on almost all signatures in compile_node is a bit much
      and super prone to errors.  How about putting all Sig* into a list upon
      creation, and then just free that list when the compilation process is over?
        this is similar to how we deal with freeing Objects with the GC

    Implement deleting from hash table - need to use tombstones

    Intern strings - create a "strings" table in vm

    Test Edge cases by writing toy programs - save these programs as correctness tests

    Stress test by writing script to load nyc_subway data - compare runtime to python pandas

    Write benchmarking code to use with chrome://tracing to find hotspots

    Why are if /else so much slower than just if (think of the fibonacci example


StatementList should be DeclList - all programs are a list of declarations
  decl - classDecl | funDecl | varDecl | stmt
      leave no effect on the stack
  stmt - exprStmt | forStmt | ifStmt | printStmt | returnStmt | whileStmt | block
      exprStmt are expressions where the result is discarded (pop the stack)
  expr - Literal | Unary | Binary | SetVar | GetVar
      push one value on the stack
