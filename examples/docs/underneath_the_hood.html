                <h3>The Parser</h3>
                <p>
                    The tokenized source code is parsed using vanilla recursive descent - see the source code for
                    implementation details.  One point of note is that the abstract syntax tree (AST) nodes are reordered
                    before being passed to the compiler.<br><br>
                    Enumerations, structs and statically defined functions are all reordered so that they are compiled
                    first.  Any circular dependencies are also resolved at this time.  The reordering of the AST nodes
                    was done in order to remove the need for header files or foward declarations that plague C and C++.

                <p>
                    The compiler has two main responsibilities: compiling the AST nodes into Cebra bytecode for the 
                    virtual machine, and to perform static type-checking.

                <p>
                    Cebra uses a stack-based virtual machine during runtime, and has a tracing gargabe collector for automatic
                    memory management.
