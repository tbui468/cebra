        <h3>Building From Source</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <section class="col-3-4">
                <p>The source code is available on Github at https://github.com/tbui468/cebra.  I'm not distributing executables at the time, so you'll
                have to build it for your machine. 
                You'll need a c compiler (such as gcc or clang), a build tool (make, ninja, etc), and a build system generator (we'll use CMake).</br></br>

                If you're on any Linux distribution, I'll assume you already know what to do. </br></br>

                On Windows, installing Visual Studio will include a compiler and build tool.  Then community edition is free to use.  
                Then install CMake and be sure to include it in the command line path.</br></br>

                On MacOS, CMake (and the compiler + build tool) can easily be installed using Homebrew.  For more detailed instructions, 
                follow steps 1 and 2 here https://cse.engineering.nyu.edu/cs653/OpenGLCompilationMacLinux8.pdf to get CMake.
                Homebrew should also recognize any missing dependencies required for CMake (c compiler and build tool) and tell 
                you what you need to install.</br></br>
                </p>
                <p> The following commands will use the default configurations, build tool and compiler.  Consult the CMake docs for more build options.
                Once built, the executable should be in cebra/build/src/Debug if using Windows and cebra/build/src on Linux/MacOS (probably).</p>

                <p>
                    GCC is a C and C++ compiler, which can be called by Make.  Make is a build tool that helps the user configure compiling, 
                    linking and other configuration options when using a compiler.  And CMake is a build generator that can create 
                    configuration files for build tools like Make, so that it can call the compiler to create executables.  Yeah, I was confused at first too.

                following will run the executable with the script in the examples directory.  The ./ in front of the executable 
                can be omitted on Windows.</p>
