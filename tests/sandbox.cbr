f: file = open("test.txt")
//write(f, "This text will replace everything in file")
//append(f, "This text will be attached to end of file")
//src := readln(f) will read next line - what happens if end of file?
//OR allow multiple returns, and return a string + success code?  (empty string + true means end of line, empty string + false means end of file)
//src := read(f) will read entire file, regardless of where current read pointer is
