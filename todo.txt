Rewrite tests
    make it more like in vaquita
        each test is a separate file (eg, test.cbr)
        each expected output is separate file (eg, text.exp)

        have python each test using the interpreter and output
        colored results

Architecture
    lex source
    parser into AST
    process AST (reorder to make depenency order not matter)
    compile
    vm
    memory manager
