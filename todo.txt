Rewrite tests
    make it more like in vaquita
        each test is a separate file (eg, test.cbr)
        each expected output is separate file (eg, text.exp)

        have python each test using the interpreter and output
        colored results

Make README
    build instructions
    examples
    supported features
    architecture
    todo
